# Installation

You can install this bundle in MailMate by opening the preferences and going to the bundles tab. After installation it will be automatically updated for you.

# Usage

Select a few - or many! - messages in any folder or in your Inbox.

With those messages selected, you have access to four visualization commands:

- Emails by correspondents (shortcut: `^c`)
- Emails by sender (shortcut: `^b`)
- Emails by time (shortcut: `^t`)
- Emails by tag (shortcut: `^g`)

The plots will then be displayed in Safari.

Hover over parts of the pie chart, bars in the bar chart, or dots in the scatterplot to display more information.

Use the "Save as Image" buttons to produce `.png`s from the plots for your records.

Have fun :)
